## Hi, I'm Liam.

I am a Software Engineer who designs, develops, and deploys high-quality software. I obtained my B.S. as a dual major in Computer Science & Business and Management from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu). As a computer scientist, runner, guitarist, and climbing enthusiast, embracing challenge defines me. Leaning into hard problems helps me grow and develop both professionally and personally.

Thank you to my friends and family for helping me become who I am today.
