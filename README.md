## Hi, I'm Liam.

I obtained my B.S. as a dual major in Computer Science & Business and Management from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu). Currently working as a Software Engineer at [Guidance Analytics](https://github.com/guidance-analytics), I aspire to design, develop, and deploy high-quality products to address and satisfy the needs of real people. At the core of my being, I believe that treating others with kindness and respect is necessary in every interaction in one's life. These interactions are the key to authentic human connection and meaningful progress.

As a computer scientist, runner, guitarist, and (recent) climbing enthusiast, embracing challenge defines me. Leaning into genuinely hard problems has helped me grow more than I could ever have imagined.

Thank you to my friends and family for helping me become who I am today.
