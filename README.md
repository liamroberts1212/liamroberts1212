## Hi, I'm Liam.

I work as a Software Engineer at [Guidance Analytics](https://github.com/guidance-analytics). I obtained my B.S. as a dual major in Computer Science & Business and Management from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu). I aspire to design, develop, and deploy high quality products to address and satisfy the needs of real people. At the core of my being, I believe that treating others with kindness and respect is necesarry in every interation in one's life, acting as the key to authentic human connection and meaningful progress.

I am a runner, guitarist, and (recent) climbing enthusiast. I aspire to become a better version of myself every day. As an avid learner, I embrace new challenges and lean into genuinely hard problems.
