## Hi, I'm Liam.

I obtained my B.S. as a dual major in Computer Science & Business and Management from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu). Currently working as a Software Engineer at [Guidance Analytics](https://github.com/guidance-analytics), I aspire to design, develop, and deploy high-quality software to address and satisfy significant needs of individuals. Treating others with kindness and respect is necessary in every interaction in one's life. These interactions are the key to authentic human connection and meaningful progress.

As a computer scientist, runner, guitarist, and (recent) climbing enthusiast, embracing challenge defines me. Leaning into genuinely hard problems continually helps me grow and develop both professionally and personally.

Thank you to my friends and family for helping me become who I am today.
